Hi, Iâ€™m Blessing A. Sithole (@Blessing-dev1).

I'm a rising junior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a strong passion for Machine Learning, AI, and Software Engineering. Iâ€™ve already earned the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate and am currently pursuing the Microsoft AI & ML Engineering and AWS Cloud Solutions Architect certifications.

I enjoy building innovative, real-world applications using cloud platforms, AI tools, and full-stack technologies. As part of my commitment to growth, I'm developing two new projects every month until I graduate in 2027.

I'm eager to collaborate on impactful software and AI projectsâ€”whether it's building something new or optimizing existing systems.
